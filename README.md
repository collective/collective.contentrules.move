# Rationale

Replaces the default plone.app.contentrules move function.

This package is likely to be little more than a proof of concept to be merged
back into p.a.contentrules.

The current contentrules move seems over complicated. This is simplified, uses
the plone api and allows the creator of the rule to bypass restrictions.
